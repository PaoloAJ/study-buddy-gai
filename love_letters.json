  "Joey, \nYou have taught me what it means to love unconditionally, and to be loved unconditionally. I don't think I can ever thank you enough for that. \nI love you! \nForever yours, \nDivi",
  "Joey, \nThank you for always knowing how to make me smile. Whenever I'm feeling down, my first instinct is to come home to you. Even if I don't quite know what I'm feeling, I know that you will always be there to support me. I smile just thinking about it. I hope I make you smile the same, baby. \nI love you! \nForever yours, \nDivi",
  "Joey, \nI love your thoughtfulness, generosity, and chivalry. You always make me feel like a princess. You truly are my prince. <br>I love you! \nForever yours, \nDivi"
