  "Joey, <br>Thank you for always knowing how to make me smile. Whenever I'm feeling down, my first instinct is to come home to you. Even if I don't quite know what I'm feeling, I know that you will always be there to support me. I smile just thinking about it. I hope I make you smile the same, baby. <br>I love you! <br>Forever yours, <br>Divi",
